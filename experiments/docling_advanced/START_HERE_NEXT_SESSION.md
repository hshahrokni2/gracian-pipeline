- Path B overview (refactor)
- Risk mitigation
- Files you need

**Best for**: Getting started immediately

---

### 3. **HOW_TO_WIN_NEXT_STEPS.md** (15-minute read) 📖
**When to use**: You want comprehensive strategy + philosophy

**What's inside**:
- Complete strategic assessment
- Victory report (where we are)
- Decision point analysis
- Path A: Full execution plan (3-4 hours)
- Path B: Full execution plan (3-4 weeks)
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Success metrics (leading + lagging)
- Winning philosophy
- Session playbook (step-by-step)
- Quick reference cheat sheet

**Best for**: Understanding full context and philosophy

---

## ⚡ **IF YOU ONLY DO ONE THING (30 seconds)**

```bash
cd ~/Dropbox/zeldadb/zeldabot/pdf_docs/Gracian\ Pipeline/experiments/docling_advanced
python code/test_multi_pdf_consistency.py
```

**This single test will tell you EXACTLY what to do next.**

## 🎯 The Critical Decision

### Where We Are
- **Current**: 86.7% coverage achieved (Oct 12 daytime)
- **Target**: 95/95 (95% coverage, 95% accuracy)
- **Status**: ✅ EXCEEDS 75% target (production-ready!)

### The Question
**Should we refactor 15-20 hours OR enhance 3-4 hours?**

### The Answer
**RUN THE VALIDATION TEST FIRST** (30 minutes)

---

## 📊 Decision Framework (Automatic)

**After test, check avg_coverage and std_dev**:

```
IF avg ≥85% AND std_dev <5%:
   → Path A: Enhance (3-4 hours → 90%+)
   → Risk: LOW
   → Files: validate_layered_routing.py, base_brf_extractor.py

ELIF avg 80-85% OR std_dev <10%:
   → Investigate first (2-4 hours)
   → Then decide Path A or B

ELSE (avg <80% OR std_dev >10%):
   → Path B: Refactor (3-4 weeks but data-justified)
   → Risk: HIGH
   → Start: specialist_note4_utilities.py
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

### Best Case (Path A, avg ≥85%)
- 30 min validation
- 3-4 hours fixes
- 90-92% coverage
- ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

### Good Case (Path A, cautious)
- 30 min validation
- 2-4 hours investigation
- Clear direction for enhancement

### Learning Case (Path B needed)
- 30 min validation
- Data justifies refactoring
- 3-4 weeks to 95%+
- But informed by data

---

## 💡 The Winning Philosophy

> **"Test first, decide later. Data > Intuition. Done > Perfect."**

**Why This Works**:
1. **De-risks**: Don't refactor until proven necessary
2. **Fast**: 30 min testing > weeks of speculation
3. **Safe**: Don't throw away 86.7% working solution
4. **Smart**: Let reality guide strategy, not theory

## 🚀 What to Read Next

**If you have 3 minutes**:
→ Read `DECISION_TREE_VISUAL.md`
→ Visual flowchart + decision matrix

**If you have 5 minutes**:
→ Read `QUICK_START_NEXT_SESSION.md`
→ Actionable steps + commands

**If you have 15 minutes**:
