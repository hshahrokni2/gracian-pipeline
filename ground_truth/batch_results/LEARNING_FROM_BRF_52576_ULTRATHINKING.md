- **Increases >3%**: ~50% of corpus
- **Fee reductions**: 8.3% of corpus (2 PDFs: brf_47809, brf_48663)
- **Fee stability (4+ years)**: ~20% of corpus (including brf_52576)

**Fee Increase Justifications Observed**:
1. **Loan refinancing** (most common): Rising interest rates
2. **Operating cost increases**: Samfälligheter, tomträtt, energy
3. **Maintenance reserves**: Building up long-term funds
4. **Inflation**: General cost-of-living adjustments

**Fee Reduction Patterns** (2 PDFs + planned):
- PDF 24 (brf_47809): -10% reduction (692 → 623 kr/m²) in 2021
- PDF 26 (brf_48663): +5% increase 2023 → planned -5% decrease 2024
- **Enablers**: High soliditet (>85%), conservative debt management, stable costs

**Fee Stability Pattern** (brf_52576 example):
- 4 consecutive years at 686 kr/m² (2020-2023)
- Enabled by: 93.5% soliditet, low debt (3,290 kr/m²)
- Strategic response: Absorb cost increases through equity buffer
- 2024 increase: +5% when multiple cost pressures align

**Strategic Insight**: BRFs with high soliditet (>90%) can:
1. Hold fees constant during cost increases (absorb via equity)
2. Plan strategic fee reductions when costs stabilize
3. Avoid emergency fee hikes by managing cash reserves
